# Brainfuck Interpreter in Zig

This project implements a Brainfuck interpreter using the Zig programming language. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalism and simplicity, making it an interesting subject for interpreter implementation.

<br>

ðŸš§ This project is currently a **WIP** ðŸš§

## Features

- Implements all standard Brainfuck commands: `>`, `<`, `+`, `-`, `.`, `,`, `[`, and `]`
- Uses Zig's memory safety features and error handling
- Configurable memory size (default: 30,000 cells)

## Requirements

- Zig compiler (tested with version 0.10.0)

## Building the Project

1. Ensure you have Zig installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Zig website](https://ziglang.org/download/).

2. Clone this repository.

3. Compile the project using the following command:

   ```
   zig build bf-interpreter
   ```

4. This will create an executable named `bf-interpreter` (or `bf-interpreter.exe` on Windows).

## Running the Interpreter

1. After building the project, you can run the interpreter using:

   ```
   ./brainfuck
   ```

2. By default, it will run a "H" Brainfuck program. You can modify the `input` variable in the `main` function to run different Brainfuck programs.

## Brainfuck Commands

The interpreter supports the following Brainfuck commands:

- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right
- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left
- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer
- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer
- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer
- `,`: Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer
- `[`: If the byte at the data pointer is zero, jump to the matching `]`
- `]`: If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, jump back to the matching `[`

## Modifying the Interpreter

- You can change the `MEMORY_SIZE` constant to adjust the number of memory cells available to the Brainfuck programs.

## Future todos:

- [ ] Take arguments of zig files
- [ ] Add the debug command

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the interpreter or extend its functionality are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
