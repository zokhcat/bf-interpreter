# Brainfuck Interpreter in Zig

This project implements a Brainfuck interpreter using the Zig programming language. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalism and simplicity, making it an interesting subject for interpreter implementation.

<br>

ðŸš§ This project is currently a **WIP** ðŸš§

## Features

- Implements all standard Brainfuck commands: `>`, `<`, `+`, `-`, `.`, `,`, `[`, and `]`
- Includes a debug command `#` for easier debugging of Brainfuck programs
- Uses Zig's memory safety features and error handling
- Configurable memory size (default: 30,000 cells)

## Requirements

- Zig compiler (tested with version 0.10.0)

## Building the Project

1. Ensure you have Zig installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Zig website](https://ziglang.org/download/).

2. Clone this repository or download the `brainfuck.zig` file.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `brainfuck.zig`.

4. Compile the project using the following command:

   ```
   zig build-exe brainfuck.zig
   ```

5. This will create an executable named `brainfuck` (or `brainfuck.exe` on Windows).

## Running the Interpreter

1. After building the project, you can run the interpreter using:

   ```
   ./brainfuck
   ```

2. By default, it will run a "Hello World!" Brainfuck program. You can modify the `input` variable in the `main` function to run different Brainfuck programs.

## Brainfuck Commands

The interpreter supports the following Brainfuck commands:

- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right
- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left
- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer
- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer
- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer
- `,`: Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer
- `[`: If the byte at the data pointer is zero, jump to the matching `]`
- `]`: If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, jump back to the matching `[`
- `#`: (Debug) Print the current instruction pointer and the first 10 memory cells

## Modifying the Interpreter

- You can change the `MEMORY_SIZE` constant to adjust the number of memory cells available to the Brainfuck programs.
- The debug command `#` can be useful for understanding the state of the memory during program execution. Feel free to modify its behavior as needed.

Contributions to improve the interpreter or extend its functionality are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
